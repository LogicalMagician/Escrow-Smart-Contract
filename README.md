For the Depositor:

Open your Ethereum wallet and ensure you have sufficient funds to deposit into the contract.
Deploy the Escrow contract by copying and pasting the code into the Solidity compiler and following the steps to deploy it.
Assign a recipient to the contract by calling the assignRecipient function and providing the recipient's Ethereum address as an argument.
Deposit Ether into the contract by sending the desired amount to the contract address.
Check the contract to confirm that the funds have been deposited and are available to be withdrawn by the recipient.
Once the recipient has confirmed receipt of the goods or services, call the markComplete function to allow the recipient to withdraw the funds.
For the Recipient:

Open your Ethereum wallet and ensure you have access to your private key or seed phrase.
Ask the depositor to provide you with the address of the Escrow contract.
Check the contract to confirm that the funds have been deposited and are available to be withdrawn by you.
Call the acknowledgeFunding function to confirm that you have received the goods or services and are ready to withdraw the funds.
Wait for the depositor to mark the trade as complete.
Once the trade is marked as complete, call the withdraw function to withdraw the funds.
Note that if the depositor cancels the trade, the recipient will not be able to withdraw the funds until the depositor releases them, or until 7 days have passed since the cancelation. The depositor can release the funds to themselves at any time by calling the releaseToDepositor function. If the trade is canceled and the depositor does not release the funds, the recipient can call the refundDepositor function after 7 days have passed since the cancelation to refund the funds to the depositor.



This escrow contract is designed to be safe and secure for both parties involved, as it provides a mechanism for enforcing the terms of the trade and preventing fraud or theft of funds. Here are some of the key safety features of this contract:

Only the depositor can deposit funds and mark the trade as complete, ensuring that the recipient cannot withdraw funds without the depositor's authorization.

The recipient must acknowledge funding of the escrow contract by calling the acknowledgeFunding function, which ensures that the depositor cannot withdraw the funds until the recipient has confirmed receipt of the goods or services.

The canceled boolean variable ensures that the trade cannot be executed if it has been canceled by the depositor.

The refundDepositor function provides a mechanism for the depositor to refund themselves if the recipient does not acknowledge the cancelation within 7 days.

The use of require statements in the code ensures that certain conditions must be met before a function can be executed, preventing unauthorized access to the funds in the contract.

Overall, this escrow contract provides a secure and transparent way for two parties to trade funds without the risk of fraud or theft.
